[BETA] State Creation Tool for victoria 3

This tool helps with creation of new states in Victoria 3, by creating new text files containing information about created/changed states.

The user inputs number of states to be creates folowed by information about them (name, id, and provinces to be transfered). The program then calculates amount of resources, pops etc. to transfer to this states and prints them into new files. This state entries can be then copied into the mod files.

current limitations:
- no ability to transfer provinces to existing states 
- the program doesn't handle strategic regions
- the amount of resources/pops/buildings transfered to new states is calculated based on the ratio of provinces transferred, with no way to influence it

future plans:
- ability to transfer provinces into existing stats
- printing the files directly into mod folder
- printing into existing files, so the state entry don't need to be copied manually
- keeping track of the hitory of tranfers
- printing localization for the states
- adding ways to influence amount of transfered resources
- graphical UI
